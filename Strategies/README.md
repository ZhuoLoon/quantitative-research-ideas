The goal of successful algorithmic trading is to design a 
successful strategy that achieves consistent returns.

Most strategies used by buy-side quantitative hedge funds
can be broadly categorised into "mean-reversion" and "momentum",

increasing popular recently.

A simple mean reversion and momentum strategies are discussed
