### Clustering -- Grouping correlated securities into baskets

In finance, clustering is often used as a
building block before further processing 
such as portfolio selection. The task can be 
loosely described as  grouping objects in
subsets in such a way that objects in the same
cluster are more similar to each other
than those in different clusters.

 This is valuable information and can be used
 in various ways. For instance, the familiar
 "pairs trading" strategy requires pairs
 of highly correlated securities, which
 clustering can help to identify. More generally,
 clustering is a necessity for cross-sectional
 statistical arbitrage strategies.
 
Clustering can be extremely tricky in finance.
Correlations are often unstable, and volatility is
highly variable. Building a sound clustering
methodology is an open problem, with much
research going on across quant firms.
